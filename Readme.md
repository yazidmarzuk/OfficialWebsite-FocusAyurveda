This is a website build for Focus Ayurvedic Solutions.

It is made using HTML, CSS And JavaScript

Feel free to use this code for personal projects. 

<!-- 
## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo
Many people have contacted me asking if they can use this code for their own websites. The answer to that question is usually "yes", with attribution. There are some cases, such as using this code for a business or something that is greater than a personal project, that we may be less comfortable saying yes to. If in doubt, please don't hesitate to ask us.

We value keeping this site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. We spent a non-negligible amount of effort developing, designing, and trying to perfect this iteration of our website, and we are proud of it! All we ask is to not claim this effort as your own. -->
